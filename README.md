When Facebook came along back in 2004, it was a total game changer — and the powerhouse platform has continued to dominate the social media landscape ever since. Facebook, which turns 18 this year, has become so deeply woven into the fabric of our lives that many of us don’t necessarily question whether it’s still relevant.
Facebook parent Meta-The metaverse” is an online alternative universe that’s been predicted (or at least imagined) for decades. The word was first mentioned by writer Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel Snow Crash. Basically, the projection is that we’re moving closer to a world where we can meet our friends for coffee, go shopping (and spend real money) or host a business meeting, using virtual or augmented reality, from the comfort of our homes. Mark Zuckerberg has referred to the metaverse as “the next chapter for the internet”*, and Meta’s solid investment in this new reality (and name change to boot) indicates how deeply they believe in its viability. To start with, their high-tech virtual reality headset looks set to be released at the end of this year.Mark Zuckerberg has referred to the metaverse as “the next chapter for the internet”.



And yet, earlier this month Facebook stocks plummeted by an astronomical $232 billion in one day. For an organisation that has set a lot of records, this was a new one: the biggest single-day drop in company stocks that the US had ever seen.

The main thing that precipitated the drop was Meta’s announcement that, for the first time ever, the number of people using Facebook has decreased. There were 1 million fewer Facebook users in the most recent quarter than in the one previous.

Interestingly, Meta attributed the situation to “headwinds from both increased competition for people’s time and a shift of engagement.”* In other words, the social media market is saturated, and people are using social media differently to how they used to.

Meta also pointed out that their investment in the metaverse contributed to their net loss. The company poured $10 billion into ventures in the metaverse (more on that in a moment), and analysts estimate that Meta will spend another $60 billion on the metaverse in coming years.*

Bank of America analysts predict that Facebook will bounce back in the second half of 2022*, but there are plenty of experts suggesting this might be the beginning of the end for the platform.

Facebook's value proposition\

In 2013, the Facebook mission is simply to 'make the world more open and connected'.

Previously, it described itself as:

'a social utility that helps people communicate more efficiently with their friends, family and coworkers. The company develops technologies that facilitate the sharing of information through the social graph, the digital mapping of people’s real-world social connections. Anyone can sign up for Facebook and interact with the people they know in a trusted environment'.

You almost certainly know the story behind how the Facebook value proposition developed from watching the 2010 film The Social Network? It describes how Facebook was founded while Mark Zuckerberg was a student at Harvard University - initially for limited Harvard student membership. The initial viral effect of the software was indicated since more than half of the undergraduate population at Harvard registered on the service within the first month!


Value proposition for marketers and businesses
Facebook works hard to monetise its audience particularly since it held its initial public offering (IPO) on May 18, 2012. This was the biggest IPO for an Internet company, with a peak market capitalization of over $104 billion. Facebook describes its offer to businesses as...

'Marketers can engage with more than one billion monthly active users on Facebook or subsets of our users based on information people have chosen to share with us such as their age, location, gender, or interests. We offer marketers a unique combination of reach, relevance, social context, and engagement to enhance the value of their ads'.

Commercial companies or Not-For-Profit organizations can also create their own Facebook Pages for their company (currently free). Facebook users can then express their support by adding themselves as a fan, writing on the company Wall, uploading photos, and joining other fans in discussion groups. When users become fans, they can optionally agree to be kept up to date about developments which then appear in their news feeds.


Facebook's revenue model
Facebook has an ad-based revenue model. Some of the features of Facebook Ads  include:

Targeting by age, gender, location, interests, and more.
Alternative payment models: cost per click (CPC) or impression-based (CPM).
‘Trusted Referrals’ or ‘Social Ads’ – ads can also be shown to users whose friends have recently engaged with a company’s Facebook page or engaged with the company website.
